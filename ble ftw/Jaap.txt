Mr. Jaap Haartsen once told me that he used to have his secret mode of transmission through a technology he invented. There is a saying that he still have one message that no one could ever decrypt. I still have that file and I challenge you to retieve that message.
PS: Mr. Jaap loved the beeps and boops of his Wireless Earbuds
